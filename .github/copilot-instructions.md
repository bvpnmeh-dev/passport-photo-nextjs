# Copilot Layout Instructions for "Get Digital Photo Code" Landing Page

## CRITICAL: Layout Structure Specification

You are building a landing page that must match **EXACTLY** the provided design. The code logic is done—you are **ONLY** responsible for the **exact layout**, spacing, structure, and visual hierarchy. Do not modify functionality; only ensure layout precision.

---

## **Section 1: Navigation Header**

Create a top navigation bar with the following structure:

- **Left side:** "Get digital photo code" (logo/brand text)
- **Right side:** Four navigation links in this exact order:
  - Services
  - Pricing
  - Locations
  - Contact

Use a simple, clean layout. The bar should span full width with appropriate padding. Text should be aligned horizontally with consistent spacing between items.

---

## **Section 2: Hero Section with Trust Metrics**

Below the header, create a prominent hero section containing:

**Top row (trust metrics):**

- "4.4/5" (rating)
- "2,800+ customers" (reviews count)
- "98% approved" (approval rate)

These three metrics should be displayed in a row, centered, with equal spacing between them.

**Main headline (below metrics):**

- "UK HMPO Compliant Passport Photos"

This should be large, bold, and centered text.

---

## **Section 3: Four-Step Process Flow**

Create a visual step-by-step process with **exactly 4 steps** displayed horizontally:

1. "Upload a photo"
2. "Photo approved compliant"
3. "Download + digital code"
4. "Done"

Each step should be numbered (1, 2, 3, 4) and displayed in a horizontal layout with clear visual separation between steps. Use arrows or connecting lines between steps (← → style).

---

## **Section 4: Pricing Cards Section**

Each card should have consistent width, padding, and visual hierarchy. Cards should be contained in boxes with subtle borders or background colors.

- DVLA Licence Photos (with ← → navigation arrows)

## **Layout Guidelines**

1. **Width:** All sections should use full-width design with proper max-width constraints for readability
2. **Spacing:** Maintain consistent padding between sections (approximately 40-60px vertical spacing between major sections)
3. **Typography:** Use a clean, modern font. Ensure proper hierarchy with varying font sizes
4. **Colors:** Use a professional color scheme (suggest light backgrounds with dark text and accent colors for buttons/links)
5. **Responsiveness:** Cards and grids should stack on smaller screens
6. **Alignment:** All text should be properly centered or left-aligned as shown in the PDF
7. **Buttons/Links:** Style consistently with clear hover states
8. **Visual Separation:** Use subtle dividers or spacing to separate distinct sections

---

## **Key Emphasis**

- **DO NOT change the order of sections**
- **DO NOT omit any elements**
- **DO maintain exact text and information hierarchy**
- **DO ensure responsive behavior for mobile/tablet/desktop**
- **DO use consistent styling throughout**
- **The logic/functionality is already coded—focus purely on layout precision**
